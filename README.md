## Lua script for Yimmenu to play various GTA 5 animations.

## FAQ :

_Yimmenu already has a built-in animation player. Why use a separate script?_

- This script spawns animation props. It's the only reason why I wrote it.
- You don't have to configure the animations. The appropriate flags are already setup.

_Why are there only a few animations?_

- This is a work in progress I added a handful of animations for testing purposes. More will be added as I find the time to do so.

## Known Issues :

- ~~Sometimes when stopping an animation, the player's character may clip through the ground. This happens with low positioned animations like sitting or lying down. I don't know why but for now, just tap W after stopping the animation and you should be positioned correctly.~~ **FIXED.**

- ~~When changing to a different animation without stopping the previous one, the prop will become stuck to your character so make sure yo press the **Stop** button before choosing a different animation.~~ **FIXED.** *(n00b mistake)*.
